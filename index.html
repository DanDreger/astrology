	<p>If you feel as if you can’t make anything go the way you want it to go this week, keep trying! Early next week Mercury the communicator goes out of phase in your sign through early 2017 and Murphy’s Law of “whatever can go wrong will go wrong” will be your swan song.</p>
	<p>
	So this is a week to strive harder than usual and tick those things off your to do list. A Super Moon beaming on your 6th house of hard work will be just the cosmic mojo you need too. Winding things down and bringing the year to a harmonious close is something to strive for.<br>

	Your lucky numbers this week are: 2, 19, 26, 34 and 45

	<img src="img/aquarius.png">
	<p>This is a very sexy week indeed for you Aquarius, with mid week’s Super Moon shining in Gemini, your romance and fun zone. Plus a nice combo of the Sun in Sags and Uranus your ruler in Aries around the same time as the Super Moon means that the last thing you expected would happen could very well happen!</p>
	<p>
	And don’t you love a surprise? Work hard this week because over the weekend Mercury the planner of the zodiac prepares to go into retrograde mode, which is sure to throw a spanner in many holiday works.<br>

	Your 5 lucky numbers this week are: 8, 19, 24, 27 and 36.

	<p>The Sun continues to shine a bright spotlight on your career and reputation zone and this week gets into a trine with fiery Uranus in your money zone. There is no better time to ask for a pay rise/promotion or share of the profits at work than now.
	</p>
	<p>In fact next week it will be a huge muddle with Mercury going out of phase in your hopes and wishes zone through early January 2017. So step up to the plate and ask!<br>

	<p>As we approach the end of the year the last Super Moon of the year hovers midweek in your money and self worth zone. Worried about overdoing the holiday budget already? It’s easily done and sometimes you have regrets afterwards when you end up with a pile of crappy gifts versus the fabulous things you shelled out on.</p>
	<p>Don’t do it this year Bulls. Why not Secret Santa the hell out of everyone? Keeping the maximum spending lower and keep your budget in mind when out and about shopping.<br>

	<p>It can’t get much better than this astrologically for you Twins, so if you’re in a grumpy mood, snap out of it now! Your annual Full Moon midweek is the final Full Moon of 2016 and happens to be a Super Moon to boot...an unmistakable message that the finale is upon us.</p>
	<p>It’s time to complete all those things that you’ve left until the last minute with your ruler Mercury getting ready to go out of phase late Sunday. The Sun in your relationship zone aligning with erratic Uranus in your friendship zone makes this a great time to join forces with others. Aquarians, Sags and Aries especially.<br>

<h1>Cancer!</h1> 
	<img src="img/cancer.png">
	<p>With the last Full Moon/Super Moon for the year lighting up the skies on Tuesday in your past karma and self–renewal zone, this is a week of forgiving yourself for all those “woulda, coulda, shoulda moments” and instead focusing on ending 2016 feeling ready to charge forward into 2017.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately Mercury the communicator, is getting ready to go out of phase in your one on one relationship zone early next week, which will definitely throw a wrench in the works.<br>

	<p>A great week for you fiery lions, with the Sun in Sagittarius getting caught up in a trine to Uranus on Monday. In your romance and unexpected zone respectively, this will have some of you facing something or someone unexpected, and being a rather stubborn lion, not sure you are ready to change your plans or mind at a moment’s notice.</p>
	<p>Go on, be daring! Aries, Aquarius and Sags will all be fabulous allies for you over the next few weeks. If you’re stuck in a rut, they come armed with shovels and help dig you out!<br>

	<p>Two positive fire trines and a Full Moon make this a week to dream big and which you won’t quickly forget. The Sun in your sign makes its second trine of the year with fiery Uranus on Monday.</p>
	<p>Even though Uranus remains out of phase through late December, this cosmic combo can still shake things up. There will be a nice gift in it for you though as the Gemini Super Moon the next day lights up your relationship zone. Any lingering doubts you’ve had about someone and their loyalty to you will finally be answered Sags.<br>
